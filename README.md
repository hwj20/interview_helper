# Interview Helper

This is an AI-powered interview helper, currently under development. Please ignore that the UI is still using tkinter, and some of the comments in the code are in Chinese. 

## Requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Insert your OpenAI API key in `openai_utils.py`

## Usage:
1. Run `main.py` (you can ignore the other Python files; they are used for testing purposes).

## Testing:
- Upload your CV.
- Speak directly to the microphone, and it will automatically identify whether the speaker is the applicant or the interviewer.

**Note:** I'm actively working on connecting the system output to this helper.
